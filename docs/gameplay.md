# Exploding Kittens Gameplay Overview
## Objective:

Be the last player remaining by avoiding drawing an Exploding Kitten card.

## Setup

1. Remove the Exploding Kitten and Defuse Cards from the deck.
2. Deal 7 cards to each player (randomly drawn from the remaining deck).
3. Give each player 1 Defuse card (so each player starts with 8 cards total).
4. Shuffle the Exploding Kitten cards back into the deck. The number of Exploding Kitten cards should be one less than the number of players (e.g., for 4 players, use 3 Exploding Kitten cards).
5. Shuffle the deck again and place it in the center.

## Turn Structure

On your turn, you can:

1. Play a card (optional) – You may play as many action cards as you want and follow their effects.
2. Draw a card (mandatory) – At the end of your turn, draw the top card from the deck.
-- If it’s an Exploding Kitten and you don’t have a Defuse, you lose the game.
-- If you have a Defuse, you can use it and secretly place the Exploding Kitten back anywhere in the deck.

## Card Actions & Strategies

- Defuse: Prevents you from exploding and lets you strategically place the Exploding Kitten back into the deck.
- Nope: Cancels another player’s action (except Exploding Kitten and Defuse).
- Attack: Ends your turn immediately and forces the next player to take two turns in a row.
- Skip: Ends your turn without drawing a card.
- Favor: Forces another player to give you a card of their choice.
- Shuffle: Shuffles the deck, useful when you suspect an Exploding Kitten is coming.
- See the Future: Look at the top three cards of the deck, helping you plan your next move.
- Cat Cards (Matching Pairs & Special Combos): These don’t have abilities on their own but can be used in combinations to steal cards.

## Winning the Game

- Players keep taking turns until all but one player has exploded.
- The last remaining player wins the game.

## Tips & Strategies

- Save your Defuse for when you really need it.
- Bluff and mislead opponents about the location of Exploding Kittens.
- Use “See the Future” wisely to manipulate your draws.
- Time your “Nope” effectively to disrupt opponents.
- Force opponents to draw an Exploding Kitten by using Attack and Favor strategically.
